# zKinectV2osc

Based on the code provided by 
Andrew McWilliams microcosm
This version builds the basic functionality defined in KinectV2-OSC to include an 6dof message (using the spineBase).  Note, the OSC message set has been redefined (to conform to existing external protocolrequirements).

This code is provided as-is, with no gurantees.
